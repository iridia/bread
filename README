WHAT IS BAKER
=============

To this day, ebooks have been limited by an old standard created in the pre-Kindle and pre-iPad era.
Baker is the first stepping stone to show that we could already be using the powerful HTML5 language
to create books with real typography, real layouts and high-quality design.


HOW TO USE BAKER
================

Creating an ebook in HTML5 to be used with Baker is a three-steps operation. 
It's easier done than said! ;)

1. DESIGN
. Create you book as one or more HTML5 documents
. Limit the width to 768px
. You can constrain the height to 1024px to match the page size or make it scrollable if you need longer pages.
. You can use ANY feature in WebKit: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
  But remember: it's a book. If you want to build an app, check PhoneGap. 
. Consider having 1 HTML for each chapter to use the native scrolling.

2. PACKAGE
. The book must be contained in a single "book/" folder.
. Each chapter (horizontally swiped on the iPad) should be in a single HTML file inside the "book/" folder.
. The HTML files must be named with incremental numbers, starting from one: 1.html, 2.html, etc.
. 1.html is going to be used as the first page of the book, so it'll probably be your cover.
. All the assets must be contained (with a relative reference) within the "book/" folder.
. Subfolders are allowed for assets, but the HTML files will be read only from the root of the "book/" folder itself.

3. PUBLISH
. Download the Baker Framework Xcode project from http://bakerframework.com or GitHub.
. Create an Apple iPhone Developer account to publish on the App Store.
. Download Xcode and the iOS SDK from the Apple Developer website.
. Open Baker in Xcode.
. Add all the files of your book from your "book/" folder to the "book/" folder inside Baker.
. If you used a CSS file to limit the width during testing, remove it.
. Rename the project to the name of your book: Project -> Rename.
. Replace the icon file: ios-icon-ipad72.png (check the Apple Guidelines for reference).
. Change the bundle identifier in the plist file to the one you are going to use for your app.
. Test your book compiling it. 
. Follow the instructions on the Apple iPhone Developer website to submit your book to the app store.
