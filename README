# Project Bread

Iridia Productions / 2010.

The bread project aims to provide an easy and affordable prototyping environment for presenting hypermedia content on the iPad.  There might be future releases to enhance portability, but that would mean that one needs to pad out discrepancies on other platforms and retrofit them to achieve performance and feature parity.

The project contains sample content, which contributions from Evadne Wu at Iridia and all of them, unless otherwise specified, is licensed under the Creative Commons BY-SA license.  The sample payload also uses jQuery, Raphaël and other libraries.

This scaffold is based on Project Baker which was licensed under the BSD License.  Take this README as a living document.


## In a nutshell

Rapid prototyping with seamless platform integration for performance at critical parts.
